.TH BDF2SUBF 1
.SH NAME
bdf2subf \- convert glyphs in a BDF file to Subfont format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bdf2subf [-f]
.IB BDF-file
.PP
or
.PP
.B bdf2subf
.IB BDF-file " [" hex-hex ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Bdf2subf
converts glyphs described in a BDF file to Plan9 style fonts.  It can
print .font format file using all the contiguous ranges of the glyphs found
in the BDF file or convert them and write
the glyph images and a Subfont structure describing them.  When
printing a .font file, or converting a specific range, the output
goes to stdout.   When converting a whole BDF file, the output will
be a number of files for each contiguous range of glyphs. The output
file name is formed by taking the basename of the
.I BDF-file
and appending the hexadecimal range of the glyphs to it.
.PP
The hexadecimal value
.I hex
corresponds to the 
.I ENCODING
keyword value in the BDF file.  Usually this represents the Unicode
encoding value for each glyph. When extracting a subrange from
a file, the
.IR hex - hex
subrange must be present in the file.
.PP
Flags are:
.PP
.BI -f
Print a .font file showing the contiguous subranges of glyphs in the BDF file. Subranges are
sorted by the
.I ENCODING
value.
.PP
When only the BDF filename is given, the program converts all
subranges found, into newly created files.  The file names for the
subranges are created using the method described earlier.
.SH EXAMPLES
To generate a file suitable for use as a '.font' file:
.IP
.EX
bdf2subf -f afont.bdf > afont.font
.EE
.LP
Subsequently, you can use the following to actually generate
the subfont files:
.IP
.EX
bdf2subf afont.bdf
.EE
.LP
In the above example the files will have the form
.I afont.xxx-xxx
where
.I xxx-xxx
is a contiguous ranges of encoding values for the glyphs found
in the file.
.LP
To view the glyphs in the subrange 600-6FF in a file, use:
.IP
.EX
bdf2subf afont.bdf  600-6FF | page
.EE
